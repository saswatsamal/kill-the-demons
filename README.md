# Kill the Demons
A space game in which you have to kill the aliens!

## Introduction
During this lockdown we all are bored and we lack entertainment except Netflix! To kill this boredom and get out from the cozy beds, we are introducing **KILL THE DEMONS** game.

**KILL THE DEMONS** is a Arduino based game where our **SPACE-FIGHTER** will kill the dangerous **DEMONS** or **ALIENS** to save the planet! 

## How to play?
- It is very simple to play.
- Turn on the game box and wait to run the program.
- After the screenloads up, press the **START** button to start the game.
- Then while the game starts, use the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** buttons to navigate your SpaceCraft and **FIRE** button to Fire Laser Shots to the Demons to kill them.
- It's very simple to use!!

## Make it Yourself


### What we have used to built this?
- Arduino Nano : (although any version of an Arduino should suffice as long as it has at least 32K of program memory). Connections to other Arduinos may vary.
- OLED : Based on a 128Ã—64 pixel I2C display. Other sizes could be used but you would have to adapt the program to comensate.
- Piezo Speaker : Must be the simple type that can be driven directly and not one that makes a noise with just power applied (this would be more normally termed a piezo buzzer).
- Tactile push buttons (3) : One for fire, 1 for left, 1 for right. Beware if building on breadboard as some do not fit correctly into the holes. You may need to mount to stripboard and then run wires to breadboard.
- Wires (several)
